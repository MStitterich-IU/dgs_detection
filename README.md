# Sign Language Detection via Action Recognition
## Overview
This repository contains the prototype of a solution designed to detect and recognize sign language gestures through action recognition.
The prototype supports the recording of training data, creating a Sequential machine learning model and training it with the previously
recorded data. In a final step the model can be used to perform sign language gestures in front of a camera and tell the user what gesture
it recognized. The main focus of the project has been the German sign language (DGS), but its functionality can easily be used for other
sign languages as well.
